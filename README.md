<h1>Restaurant Inventory Manager</h1>

The intention of this application is to allow the restaurant manager of Django Delights, a small café, to input and track the ingredients and purchases of the café.

This project can be ran by cloning or downloading source code from Github. Pip install -r requirement.txt. Python manage.py runserver.

Below is a GIF of the application demonstrating its functionality by creating an ingredient, creating a menu item, adding the ingredient to the menu item , and finally deleting the menu item and ingredient from the databse.
